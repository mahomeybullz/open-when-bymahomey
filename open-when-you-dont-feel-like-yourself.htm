    parang hindi ikaw ‘yung gumising kanina, no?<br><br>

    you looked in the mirror and something felt… off.<br>
    wala kang gana. wala kang energy. parang nagising ka sa ibang katawan.<br>
    and for a second, you thought — “asan na ‘yung ako?”<br><br>

    love, there will be days like this.<br>
    days where you don’t feel like the version of yourself you used to be.<br>
    and that’s okay. normal ‘yan.<br>
    hindi ka weird. hindi ka nawawala. nagbabago ka lang.<br><br>

    change is uncomfortable.<br>
    especially when it’s happening <em>within</em> you.<br>
    you’re shedding versions of yourself that no longer fit.<br>
    and of course it’s going to feel unfamiliar.<br>
    you’re grieving who you were, and that’s a kind of heartbreak too.<br><br>

    pero hindi ibig sabihin nun na hindi mo na kilala sarili mo.<br>
    hindi ibig sabihin nun na wala nang halaga ‘yung mga dating parts mo.<br>
    lahat ng versions mo — the joyful, the angry, the unsure, the tired, the healing —<br>
    they all existed for a reason.<br><br>

    this version? the one that feels lost?<br>
    she’s just in between chapters.<br><br>

    kaya hayaan mong maging gulo muna.<br>
    hayaan mong hindi mo muna masagot yung tanong na,<br>
    “sino ba talaga ako ngayon?”<br><br>

    trust that even in this in-between —<br>
    you are still you.<br><br>

    soft. trying. growing.<br>
    always worth loving.<br><br>

    and eventually, babalik din ‘yung feeling na “ako ulit ‘to.”
