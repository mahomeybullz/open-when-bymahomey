  <div class="content">you’re overwhelmed and that’s valid.
   
    life doesn’t come with a pause button, but if you need to take a breath — take it.  
right now. inhale. hold. exhale.  
again. slowly.

you don’t have to pretend it’s all okay.  
you don’t have to “handle it all” like some superhero.  
you’re human — beautiful, fragile, resilient.

try this: close your eyes. unclench your jaw.  
feel your shoulders drop a little.  
remind yourself: i am doing what i can.

the world might feel like it’s crashing down,  
but you don’t have to carry all of it alone.

just one small thing at a time.  
that’s how we survive the storms.

    you don’t have to solve everything right now.  
    sometimes surviving the day is already enough.
